# Service Quality and Customer Satisfaction: Text Mining of Online Hotel Reviews
In this project, we have extracted the data from tripadvisor.com. The data has 15,493 online reviews on 27 hotels written between 2010 and 2023 which can separate into
- 1,354 reviews on 2-star hotels
- 3,745 reviews on 3-star hotels
- 4,885 reviews on 4-star hotels
- 5,509 reviews on 5-star hotels

The dataset has the customer satisfaction score of the reviewers measured on a scale ranging from one to five and it also had textual reviews written in the English language. 

Therefore, this project will use text-mining techniques to measure the service quality (SERVQUAL) dimensions and their impact on customer satisfaction based on customersâ€™ reviews by using two attributes from the dataset which are customer reviews to find the service quality (SERVQUAL) dimensions and the rating from customers referred to their satisfaction. 

### Service Quality (SERVQUAL)
The service quality (SERVQUAL) model focuses on the gap between the expectations of the customer before receiving and their perceptions of the actual service delivered. The five dimensions of service quality (SERVQUAL) model represent in this paper are as the following:
- Tangibility: the impression of the physical facility, personnel, communication materials on the buyer and equipment
- Reliability: accuracy of the service
- Responsiveness: willingness to provide prompt service and quick response to customer questions or complaints
- Assurance: the knowledge and behavior of workers which generates trust and credibility for customers
- Empathy: provision of care, and individualized attention that the organization provides to its buyers
