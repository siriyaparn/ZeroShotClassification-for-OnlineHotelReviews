Very cheap, around £32.00 a night. Breakfast is excellent. The room was clean and everything worked. Minor point, no pick up at the airport as requested. Only £3.00 by taxi so not too fussed. Went down for breakfast the first morning, everything good. Went back to our room... and then the drilling and hammering started.
